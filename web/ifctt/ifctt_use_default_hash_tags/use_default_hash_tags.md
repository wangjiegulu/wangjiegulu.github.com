[中文版本](use_default_hash_tags_zh.html)

After installing IFCTT, the app will automatically create 5 below preinstalled Hash tags the first time you login in:

- **\#instapaper**：with this tag when you copy content of article, it will recognize the copied content, if it is a link, it will push the link through IFTTT to your `instapaper`
- **\#box**：with this tag when you copy content of article, it will push the content through IFTTT to your `box`, and save to the file path named `IFTTT/Email/IFCTT`.
- **\#evernote**：with this tag when you copy content of article, it will push the content through IFTTT to your `evernote`, and save to the file path named `IFTTT/Email/IFCTT`.
- **\#pocket**：with this tag when you copy content of article, it will recognize the copied content, if it is a link, it will push the link through IFTTT to your `pocket`
- **\#googledoc**：with this tag when you copy content of article, it will push the content through IFTTT to your `google docs`, and save to the file path named `IFTTT/Email/IFCTT`.

The first time you enter in, the default of all hash tags are `OFF`, as shown in the following figure:
